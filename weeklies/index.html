    <h2>What is the relationship between diagrams and meaning?</h2>
    <p>According to Dunchamp, diagrams can be used as an “artistic ‘visual language’,” which
creates meaning. Diagrams and meaning are symbiotic, in that diagrams are informed by meaning,
and meaning can be informed by diagrams. As described by American Philosopher C.S. Peirce,
diagrams are “moving pictures of thought,” a direct translation between what we think versus what
we actualize. Through this blog, I learned about Diagrammatology as a medium for art, as well as
how diagrams have historically pushed the boundaries within the art world.</p>
